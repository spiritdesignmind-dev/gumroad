      <p>After helping creators earn over $1 billion (yes, billion with a B), we've opened our entire codebase to everyone. This means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Complete freedom to use our code however you want</p></li>
        <li><p>Build on top of Gumroad for your own projects</p></li>
        <li><p>Modify anything without restrictive rules</p></li>
        <li><p>Commercial use? Absolutely allowed</p></li>
        <li><p>More features shipped faster than ever</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The MIT license is like getting the keys to the castle—maximum flexibility with minimal restrictions. Whether you want to explore how we work, contribute improvements, or build something entirely new–and even charge for it–it's all there for you.</p>
